Write a sample_files.py utility to sample X files from a directory structure.
  - Amend the project to use the python click module for any CLI argument parsing. 
  - E.g.: sample_files.py srcdir dstdir -n 300
  - Preserve the directory structure of the sampled files.
  - Sample X files at random from the root directory.
  - Provide a summary of the number of files sampled.

Create unit tests for the sample_files.py utility.
Verify the unit tests pass.

Create a README.md file for the sample_files.py utility with a description of its purpose, usage, and design.

The utility should be written in Python.
